hoisting: make variables accessible before they are actually declared

Before execution: code is scanned for variable declarations

function declarations: hoisted yes

var variables: hoisted yes, will return undefined when used before declaring it
AVOID VAR

let and const: not hoisted, initial value "uninitialized", Temporal Dead

function expressions and arrows:
depends if created with var, const or let

Temporal Dead Zone:

region of scope where variable can not be accessed (lines above declaration)

Why TDZ?: makes it easier to avoid and catch errors
